# DIAColliderMetabo
#Evaluating complex backgrounds that may cause ambiguities in the measurement
of metabolites. This tool first filters a list of identified metabolites to
remove chiral isomers (using the Inchikey). This filtered list is then used to
profile different methods for unique transitions as follows in the Q1 and Q3
phases with the mentioned filters to identify the number of unique ion
signatures (UIS) per mol_id.
